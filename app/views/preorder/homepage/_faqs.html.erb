          <summary class=''>What is sleep apnea?</summary>
          <p>Sleep apnea is a disease in which the patient completely stops breathing (apnea) or experiences reduced breathing (hypopnea) intermittently and repeatedly throughout a night.
<br />
Apneas and hypopneas disturb the sleep and cut off the oxygen supply, resulting in hypoxemia, fatigue, and poor mental performance. The exhibited symptoms include snoring, tossing and turning, sore throat, fatigue, teeth grinding, which are easily overlooked or attributed to other factors. Sleep apnea is linked to higher risks cardiovascular disease, stroke, and diabetes.

          <summary>How do I change the CSS?</summary>
          <p>Head over to <code>app/assets/stylesheets/variables.css.scss</code>. It makes it easy to change around the elements used throughout the HTML.
          <br />
          <br />
          Alternatively, you can dive right into the CSS, have a look at <code>app/assets/stylesheets/main.css.scss</code>.</p>

          <summary>Why did you release this?</summary>
          <p>Hardware startups are less welcome on Kickstarter than they were 6 months ago. We needed to roll our own kickstarter, so we did. Other hardware startups probably will too, so we made it easier for them by open sourcing our way of doing it.</p>
